# Bsm

Bsm allows you to write binary files in a human-readable way.

Bsm defines binary files like so:

```
41 42 43
```

is interpreted as

```
ABC
```

Bsm is very tolerant to spaces. Any whitespace is ignored as a separator. So if you have input like this:

```
41

42 43
```

Bsm will still output

```
ABC
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bsm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bsm

## Usage

### As a command line tool

Simply pipe a string of hexadecimals into bsm and receive the output in stdout

```
$ echo "41 42 43 0A" | bsm
ABC
```

Alternatively, give it a filename. Assune you have a file called `inputfile`, with the contents `41 42 43 44`

```
$ bsm inputfile
ABCD
```

### As a gem

Simply instantiate `Bsm::Generator`

```ruby
g = Bsm::Generator.new
puts g.generate('41 42 43')
# will result in ABC
```
